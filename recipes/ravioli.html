        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Make and knead the dough,
            then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for an hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil.
                 Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan. </li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the ravioli:</strong> Roll out the dough into sheets and brush an egg
            wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart.
            Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling.
            Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook and bake the ravioli:</strong> Boil the ravioli in salted water until the
            dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well. Bake the ravioli on a greased baking
            sheet until brown.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve the ravioli:</strong> Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
